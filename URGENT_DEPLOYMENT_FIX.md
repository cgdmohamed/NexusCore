# 🚨 URGENT: Deploy Complete API Coverage to VPS

## ⚠️ Current Issue:
- **Replit Environment**: ✅ Updated with 91 API endpoints
- **VPS Production**: ❌ Old version with missing endpoints
- **Log Shows**: 42 requests to missing `/api/tasks/stats`

## 📊 Deployment Status:
- **Ready for Deploy**: Updated `server/prod.cjs` (1432 lines)
- **Missing on VPS**: 60+ new API endpoints
- **Current VPS Success Rate**: 87.2% (with 92 error requests)
- **Expected After Deploy**: 99%+ success rate

## 🚀 Deploy Commands (Run on VPS):

### Step 1: Upload Updated Server File
```bash
# Upload the updated server/prod.cjs from Replit to your VPS
# Replace the old file at: /root/NexusCore/server/prod.cjs
```

### Step 2: Restart Production Server
```bash
cd /root/NexusCore
pm2 delete companyos
pm2 start server/prod.cjs --name companyos
pm2 save
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check if tasks/stats endpoint now works
curl -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/stats

# Monitor logs for improvement
./scripts/log-analysis.sh health
```

## 📈 Expected Results After Deployment:

### Before (Current VPS):
- ❌ `/api/tasks/stats` → 404 (42 failures)
- ❌ Multiple quotation endpoints → 404

## 🔍 File Changes:
