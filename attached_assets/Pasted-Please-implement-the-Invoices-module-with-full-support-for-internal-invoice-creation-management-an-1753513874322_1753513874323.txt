Please implement the Invoices module with full support for internal invoice creation, management, and tracking. Invoices can be created manually or generated automatically from an approved quotation. This module should include:

Invoice Details Page

Invoice number (auto-generated or editable)

Client information (linked to CRM)

Invoice date and due date

Invoice status (Draft, Sent, Paid, Paid Partially, Overdue, Cancelled)

List of items:

Item name/description

Quantity

Unit price

Line total

Optional: discounts or taxes

Summary section:

Subtotal

Tax (if applicable)

Total amount

Notes or payment terms

Actions

Create new invoice manually

Convert from quotation (auto-fill data and link records)

Download or export invoice as a clean PDF layout

Edit invoice (only in Draft status)

Mark invoice status as Paid, Cancelled, Overdue, etc.

Linking and History

Each invoice should be linked to:

The associated client (from CRM)

The originating quotation (if applicable)

The invoice view should display related quotation reference

Maintain an internal activity log for status changes and edits

Filtering and Dashboard View

Display a list of all invoices with filters by status, client, and date range

Include summary counters such as:

Total invoiced this month

Unpaid invoices

Overdue invoices

Allow search by invoice number or client name

Down Payments & Partial Payments

Enable support for down payment invoices generated from quotations.

The user should be able to specify a percentage (e.g., 30%) and the system should auto-generate a separate invoice for that amount.

The remaining balance can be invoiced later via a follow-up invoice linked to the same quotation.

Support partial payments tracking:

Allow recording multiple payments against a single invoice

Show payment history with date, amount, payment method, and internal notes

Display:

Total amount

Total paid

Balance due

Automatically update invoice status based on payment progress:

Draft → Sent → Paid Partially → Paid → Overdue (if due date is passed and not paid in full)

This module is for internal use only. All invoices must be exportable in PDF format for external sharing when needed, but no client interaction is required within the system.

Please add manual payment tracking functionality to the Invoices module. For each invoice, users should be able to record one or more payments manually. Each payment entry should include the following fields:

Payment Date

Payment Amount

Payment Method (Dropdown: Cash / Bank Transfer)

Bank Transfer Number (optional, only shown if method = Bank Transfer)

Attachment (optional upload of a payment receipt or bank transfer screenshot - image or PDF)

Notes (optional)

Each payment should be linked to its respective invoice and displayed in a "Payment History" section on the invoice view. The system should:

Automatically calculate and display:

Total Paid

Remaining Balance

Automatically update invoice status:

If total paid = invoice total → status becomes Paid

If total paid < invoice total → status becomes Paid Partially

The payment records are internal only and meant to reflect the company’s actual received payments from clients. No online payment integration is needed at this stage.
