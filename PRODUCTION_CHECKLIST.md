## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Create production database
- [ ] Set DATABASE_URL environment variable
- [ ] Set SESSION_SECRET (generate secure random string)
- [ ] Configure NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Set PORT if different from default

### 2. File Upload
- [ ] Upload application files to server
- [ ] Install Node.js dependencies (`npm install --production`)
- [ ] Build application if required
- [ ] Set proper file permissions

### 3. Database Migration
- [ ] Run database migrations (`npm run db:push`)
- [ ] Verify all tables created
- [ ] Create admin user if not exists
- [ ] Test database connectivity

### 4. Application Configuration
- [ ] Configure web server (Apache/Nginx)
- [ ] Set up URL rewriting for API routes
- [ ] Configure static file serving
- [ ] Enable SSL/HTTPS
- [ ] Set up process management (PM2/systemd)

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Database check endpoint responds (`/api/ready`)
- [ ] Admin login working
- [ ] All modules accessible
- [ ] API endpoints responding
- [ ] Static files loading

## Post-Deployment Security

### 1. Immediate Actions
- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Update admin email address
- [ ] Generate new SESSION_SECRET
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Check file permissions

### 2. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up application monitoring
- [ ] Configure error logging
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Set up backup schedule
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable gzip compression
- [ ] Configure caching headers
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Set up CDN if needed

## Environment Variables Template

```env
# Required Environment Variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-session-secret-here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Optional Variables
DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
BACKUP_SCHEDULE=daily
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Health Check Endpoints

Test these endpoints after deployment:

### System Health
```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","uptime":...}
```

### Database Connectivity
```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/ready
# Expected: {"status":"ready","database":"connected","timestamp":"..."}
```

### Authentication Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"your-new-password"}'
# Expected: User object with authentication details
```

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups
- Schedule automated PostgreSQL dumps
- Store backups in secure location
- Test restore procedures
- Maintain backup retention policy

### File System Backups
- Backup application files
- Include environment configuration
- Backup uploaded files/attachments
- Document restore procedures

## Monitoring Checklist

### Application Monitoring
- [ ] CPU usage tracking
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Disk space monitoring
- [ ] Network performance
- [ ] Response time tracking

### Database Monitoring
- [ ] Connection pool status
- [ ] Query performance
- [ ] Database size growth
- [ ] Backup verification
- [ ] Index optimization

### Security Monitoring
- [ ] Failed login attempts
- [ ] Unusual access patterns
- [ ] Security header verification
- [ ] SSL certificate expiry
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL format
   - Check database service status
   - Validate credentials

2. **Application Won't Start**
   - Check Node.js version (18+)
   - Verify all dependencies installed
   - Check application logs

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify SESSION_SECRET is set
   - Check admin user exists
   - Validate password hash

4. **API Routes 404**
   - Check URL rewriting configuration
   - Verify proxy setup
   - Check application routing

### Log Locations
- Application logs: Check hosting provider dashboard
- Web server logs: Usually in /var/log/
- Database logs: PostgreSQL log directory
- System logs: /var/log/syslog or journalctl
